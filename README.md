# Cassandra
Cassandra RPG Framerowk For Unity Engine.

## Description
Cassandra is a free open-source RPG game framework for the Unity engine.
It uses JSON to describe most of the data, which then will be compiled to Cassandra's implemented classes.

It provides the developer with an easy way of using most common RPG game features including:
- Stats & Skills 
- Abilities & Perks
- Inventory & Items
- Dialogue system
- Quest system
- Craft system
- NPC creation
- It's own scripting solution where you are able to place your C# code directly in JSON as a string.

## Roadmap
- Make GUI editor for editing Cassandra Data
- Refractor craft system
